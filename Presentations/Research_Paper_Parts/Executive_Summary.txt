// Initial methods

For the 3D model, initial efforts focused on developing a 3D model using the renowned program Solidworks. However, none of our design team knew how to use the program. Subsequently, efforts were diverted into developing in Blender, an open source 3D modeling program, however, due to technical constraints, this model was abandoned. THe current model was developed in SolidPY, a python wrapper program for OpenSCAD.
